Bioinformatics-Scripts-and-Tools
================================

Useful tools to correct quality score errors, end of file errors etc.  The code listed here is for anyone's use and modification.
No copyright is requested for this code.  Some of the code is from other open-source repositories but I made minor adjustments to 
ensure it ran well.  Some of the common problems with bioinformatics programs are that files must be formatted correctly.
Thus the goal of this repository is simply to provide scripts or ideas for methods to reformat your data.
