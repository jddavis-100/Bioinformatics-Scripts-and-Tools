Bioinformatics-Scripts-and-Tools
================================

Useful tools to correct quality score errors, end of file errors etc.  The code listed here is for anyone's use and modification. No copyright is requested for this code and all code posted is non-proprietary.  Some of the code is from other open-source repositories. I have sometimes made minor adjustments to ensure it ran well.  Some of the common problems with bioinformatics programs are that files must be formatted correctly. Thus the goal of this repository is simply to provide scripts or ideas for methods to reformat your data. 

Please feel free to add your own files, make modification to any code you'd like, etc.  From time to time I will update
this repository with non-proprietary scripts to reformat data.
