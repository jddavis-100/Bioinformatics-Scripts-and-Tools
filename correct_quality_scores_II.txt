Three methods contained in this file:




#1 use the GATK method with this add-in line; Feature improvement highlights, for any pre-#processing command, add in the following


 --fix_misencoded_quality_scores (-fixMisencodedQuals)

#What will happen is that the engine will simply subtract 31 from every quality score as it is read in, and proceed with the corrected values. Output files will include the correct scores where applicable.

#See more at: http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/discussion/1991/version-highlights-for-gatk-version-2-3#sthash.7RKwYwV2.dpuf





#2 A very short perl script to do the same sort of thing


samtools view file.bam | \
perl -lane 'if('/^#/){print; next;}  
  @qual=split //, $F[$qualIndex]; $_=chr(ord($_)+33) for(@qual); $F[$qualIndex]=join("",@qual); print join("\t",@F)' | \
samtools -bS > file.corrected.bam




#3 a python script that adds EOF, but could have a few lines included to fix quality score


phython script that could be altered to do the same thing as above
#!/usr/bin/env python
"""Python script to add missing EOF marker to BAM or BGZF files.

BAM files are compressed using BGZF, Blocked GNU Zip Format, which
is a variant of GZIP. Modern BAM files include a special empty
block at the end of the file (EOF) as a marker to help spot when
a dataset has been truncated. This is just a 28 byte BGZF block,
which when decompressed is empty.

Some early tools output valid BAM files without this optional
(but recommended) EOF marker.

This script will add the EOF marker is not already present.

WARNING: If your BAM or BGZF file is truely truncated, this will
not magically fix it. It may hide or obscure the true problem.

WARNING: To avoid excessive data writing, this script modifies
the BAM or BGZF file in situ!

Usage with one or more BAM or BGZF files:

$ ./bam_add_eof.py example1.bam example2.bam ... exampleN.bam

v0.0.0 - Original script
v0.0.1 - Use append mode to add EOF block
